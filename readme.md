### What Is The Point Of This?
I don't know. I decided to make this because I was curious how fast other people's solutions were in CodeWars. I decided to make a test for it. 
### What's Next?
1. Add more methods to test.
2. Have it output to an excel sheet or csv.
3. Cry because my implementation is slower than the number 1 result on Codewars.
### Where Do We Go From Here?
I don't know maybe I'll make a polymorphic testing suite for the speed of all kinds of different methods that allow you to quickly do this for almost anything. Probably not.
